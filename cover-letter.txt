Dear Employer, 
As a highly motivated and dedicated student with strong communication and interpersonal skills, I would like to apply for the Fellowship Program in your company. As a student I have been extensively involved in my school community, which has allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills. My involvement in various events and club activities has allowed me to work closely with my peers while supporting the school community as a whole. 
These experiences have allowed me to develop strong time management and organizational skills, which I see as being very important when seeking to work in casual employment while continuing to study.
My teachers and educators have commended me for my willingness to participate and to help out where possible along with my dedication to learn and improve in class. I enjoy working with others and believe that my strong communication skills will ensure that I can meet the expectations of this role.
Along with my passion and pursuit of a computer science degree, I believe that I have a lot to offer your organization. I am keen to develop my professional skills in the field and look forward to discussing my application with you at an interview. I have enclosed a copy of my resume for your consideration. I can be contacted at all times on the details provided above.
Thanking you in advance for your time,
Kyle Yang
